#from Ira Abalone Transcriptome Paper: Trinity (Grabherr et al. 2011) (version 10.5.2012). Parameters used were: k-mers maximum = 30 and a minimum = 2. Assembly was carried out using standard parameters in Trinity. The Trinity assembly contained alternative spliced sequence variants. By removing the redundancy of alternative splicing variants (keeping the primary variant), 222,172 contigs were reduced to 104,885 contigs.
