# pipelineraw

Shell scripts to accompany the software pipeline(s) using RNA-seq data for kinship analysis of non-model organisms

Data Pre-processing

1) Reference Genome Search
1a) Assembly if none
2) Quality Control & Alignment
2a) In-depth QC optional

Biological Analysis:

Pipeline a (high depth) vs Pipeline b (low depth)

1) Variant Calling & Genotyping (do these need to be split?)
2) IBD Calculations
3) Pedigree Reconstruction (PLINK for both here; this would be an rmd?)

Pipeline Evaluation (speed vs accuracy?)

TBD
